### GIT practice

* Team of 2 players: Player One and Player Two
* Each team has to decide which one of you does the following:
    * Create gitlab repository, 
    push initial code there, 
    give rights to another player
    * It is similar to what you have to do for team project(s)
* Add a .gitignore in project root for .idea, .gradle and *.iml
